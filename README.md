My name is Kayla Robinson and I am from Prince's George's County, Maryland; even<br>
I usually spend my time with family and friends from Baltimore. Originally, <br>
I enrolled at NCAT to study mechanical engineering, but after changing my major three<br>
times, I settled on computer science. I always loved watching crime/thriller themed <br>
entertainment, especially when a sole genius could hack into a complex system with  <br>
little to no traces of incriminating evidence. Though, I am mainly interested in game<br>
development and design, and I intend on pursuing a career in this field. I don't a <br>
lot about game development but I know I would love to learn about it especially <br>
because animation and graphics play a role. I also want build on my artistic skills <br>
through tattooing because I admire those who can bring a design to life by   <br>
having another person dedicate to it permanently. Needless to say, I want to make<br>
the most of my time during COVID-19 pandemic and authentically understand and apply <br>
the knowledge I receive to make sure I am than I was the day before. <br> <br>
